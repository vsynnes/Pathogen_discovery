# Pathogen_discovery
"An effective sequence-based pipeline for pathogen discovery", my master's thesis

Included files
==============

The main directory contains files from my master's thesis project, including 
output-files produced by SLURM, in addition to all scripts used for execution in the process.
 
The files are organized according to the corresponding stage of the pathogen discovery pipeline, 
supplied with the identical directory-name mentioned in the report. The "FASTQC"-directory contains 
data from the two quality-controls performed during the project. 

Additionally, the directory named "software" contains all the implemented Python-scripts in addition 
to the applied PRINSEQ-script. The files associated with the execution of the entire pipeline, is
found in the "pipeline"-directory (.sbatch-versions of the SLURM-scripts and SDAG-files)
